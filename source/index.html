    <h1>Talking to the moon</h1>
    <br>I know you're somewhere out there
    <br> Somewhere far away
    <br> I want you back, I want you back
    <br> My neighbors think I'm crazy
    <br> But they don't understand
    <br> You're all I had, you're all I had
    <br> At night, when the stars light up my room
    <br> I sit by myself
    <br> Talking to the moon
    <br> Trying to get to you
    <br> In hopes you're on the other side talking to me, too
    <br> Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
    <br> Oh-oh
    <br> I'm feeling like I'm famous, the talk of the town
    <br> They say I've gone mad
    <br> Yeah, I've gone mad
    <br> But they don't know what I know
    <br> 'Cause when the sun goes down, someone's talking back
    <br> Yeah, they're talking back, oh
    <br> At night, when the stars light up my room
    <br> I sit by myself
    <br> Talking to the moon
    <br> Trying to get to you
    <br> In hopes you're on the other side talking to me, too
    <br> Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
    <br> Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
    <br> Do you ever hear me calling?
    <br> (Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah) oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
    <br> 'Cause every night, I'm talking to the moon
    <br> Still trying to get to you
    <br> In hopes you're on the other side talking to me, too
    <br> Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
    <br> Oh-oh
    <br> I know you're somewhere out there
    <br> Somewhere far away
